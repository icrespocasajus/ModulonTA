\arguments{
\item{net}{List R object with as many elements as the modulon connected components provided as the input. Each element of the list contains a character vector with satellite transcription factors.}

\item{mod}{List object with each modulon constituent elements.}

\item{cc}{List with the connected components generated with find.connected.components() or regulatory cores as the output of core()}

\item{mod.query}{Name of the query modulon.}

\item{cc.query}{Name of the connected component considered as modulon regulatory core.}

\item{feature}{Target analysis feature to be displayed; one of c("Redundancy","Similarity","Overlap")}

\item{RegAUC}{Regulon activity matrix.}
}
\value{
List object with as many elements as modulons; each element contain a heatmap.
}
\description{
Plot a heatmap displaying modulon target similarity, redundancy or overlap wrt specific connected components.
}
\details{
This function generates a heatmap to explore the results of the modulon target analysis
